Zori enables the user to determine outfits for the day based on location, weather, and personal style, among other factors. This currently provides the user with different suggestions for them to take inspiration from, and later on they will be able to like or dislike the outfits (and liking the outfits will put them in a closet for further reference). 

In the furture, Zori will ultimately implement social media comment aspects and features that allow the user to further refine the suggestion algorithm (such as type of event, more specific times of days, etc).
